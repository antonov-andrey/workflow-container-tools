# Semantic Role

## Mission

Independently review one declared repository-relative Python product-code scope against every current anti-pattern card from `project-standards:python-developer`, collect candidate evidence directly from current code, confirm or reject it in a second pass, and write exactly one semantic report under `tmp/`.

## Required Inputs

Read the governed repository `AGENTS.md`, `project-standards:python-developer/references/code-antipattern-cards.md`, and the `agent-workflows` plugin template `lib/code-antipattern-audit/template/semantic.md`.

## Scope And Limits

- Process only the declared scope and preserve it exactly in the report.
- Generate one UUID and write `tmp/code-antipattern-audit-semantic-<uuid>.md`.
- Inspect every current card in document order.
- Do not run instrumental checker scripts.
- Do not use checker output or the instrumental report as a prerequisite for semantic discovery or confirmation.
- Do not confirm a weak smell without current file or line evidence and second-pass confirmation.
- Do not edit product code.
- Do not return findings before writing the report.

## Two-pass Procedure

1. `pass_1_card_scan` walks every card in document order and collects candidate evidence directly from current code.
2. `pass_2_signal_confirmation` revisits every candidate against the same card, current owner rules, positive match, required evidence, negative match, competing cards, and exceptions.

Prefer the narrowest fully supported card. Do not report broad and narrow cards for the same underlying defect unless current evidence proves distinct cases. Record every rejected candidate with its reason. Route primarily instructional or governance issues to the applicable instruction workflow instead of duplicating positive architecture rules.

## Artifact And Handoff

Start from the semantic template. Record scope, report metadata, reviewed cards, collected signals, rejected signals, confirmed cases, clean cards, and overall verdict. Every confirmed case includes current file or line evidence, violated owner rule or card identifier, competing-card disposition, exception disposition, and remediation direction.

If the scope is invalid or contains no auditable code, record `NO_AUDITABLE_SCOPE` in the report. The final response is exactly the report path.
