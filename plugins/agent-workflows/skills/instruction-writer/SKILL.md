# Instruction Writer

## Goal
Create, delete, restructure, or update repository instruction artifacts while preserving the owner model defined by `AGENTS.md`.

## When To Use
- Use this skill only when the user explicitly requests the `instruction-writer` skill or a project-local instruction-writing workflow.
- Do not trigger this skill only because a task changes one `AGENTS.md`, provider or project-local `Skill`, plugin support contract, role contract, or harness configuration.

## Canonical Sources
- `AGENTS.md`
- `agent-workflows:instruction-audit`
- `pytest`

## Inputs
- User-requested instruction-artifact scope or focus notes.
- Current repository state and current instruction-artifact changes.
- Any explicit semantic authority path or interpretation supplied by the user.

## Outputs
- Updated instruction artifacts.
- Updated direct references, code-contract tests, or project documentation artifacts when the instruction change requires them.
- Final response that states outcome, verification, and unresolved problems.

## Hard Rules
- This skill owns instruction-writing workflow only.
- Semantic audit of instruction artifacts is owned by `agent-workflows:instruction-audit`.
- Instruction artifacts are edited directly at their runtime paths; parallel template sources for generated instruction artifacts are forbidden.
- Inspect current repository state directly instead of trusting prior conversation state.
- Before changing normative instruction text, identify the concrete problem, generalized rule, and canonical owner.
- Broad instruction rewrites are forbidden unless the current issue framing identifies a concrete failure mode.
- Resolve each confirmed issue with the minimal instruction change required for that issue.
- Prefer the shortest wording that preserves the same semantics.
- When changed instruction text depends on details owned elsewhere, reference that owner instead of restating foreign-owner detail unless one owner-local trigger, boundary, or transition must stay explicit.
- In workflow text, keep steps limited to local actions and transitions; repeated requirements belong in the owning contract instead of the step text.
- When changing one instruction artifact, update direct references, mechanical checkers, and tests that enforce or reference that artifact.
- If the instruction change affects project documentation requirements, update the owning documentation artifact in the same run.

## Role-Prompt Contract
- Follow `project-standards:project-instruction-developer` and the `agent-workflows` plugin support owner `lib/subagent-role-contract.md`.
- Keep one role contract limited to mission, scope, limits, evidence requirements, handoff rules, and necessary workflow-specific execution details.
- Do not override repository-wide rules, duplicate provider standards, or copy canonical algorithms into one role prompt.
- Provider-owned Markdown role contracts or templates are canonical; consumer-local named-agent TOML is forbidden as a cross-harness dependency.

## Workflow
1. Inventory the requested instruction scope and current changed instruction artifacts.
2. Resolve the applicable owners and direct references from `AGENTS.md`.
3. Frame each intended instruction change as `Problem`, `Generalized rule`, and `Canonical owner`.
4. Apply the smallest direct artifact edit that resolves the framed problem.
5. Update any direct references, code-contract checks, tests, or project documentation artifacts required by the instruction change.
6. Run verification required by `AGENTS.md` for the changed artifact types.
7. Use `instruction-audit` only when the user explicitly requests the structured instruction-audit skill or one validated instruction-audit report.
8. Report outcome, verification, and unresolved problems.

## Verification
- Instruction-only changes require semantic reread of the changed instruction text and direct checks for the changed artifact type.
- Changes to mechanical instruction checks require the relevant `test/code/**` checks.
- Handoff verification MUST be selected from `Evidence And Verification Rules` in `AGENTS.md` for the changed artifact types.

## Anti-Patterns
- Reintroducing an audit loop into this skill.
- Treating passing mechanical checks as semantic audit.
- Adding broad rules without current evidence and a concrete failure mode.
- Duplicating repository-wide rules in one skill or role prompt instead of referencing `AGENTS.md`.
- Leaving direct references, tests, or project documentation artifacts stale after changing instruction contracts.
