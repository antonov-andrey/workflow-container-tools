# Section Audit Protocol

This file owns shared section-agent orchestration, artifact contracts, validators, and deterministic merge for structured audit skills that split one checklist into top-level section tasks. Each skill owns its scope derivation, applicable owner selection, checklist text, and final handoff.

## Required Skill Inputs
- One `audit_name` used as the run directory prefix under `tmp/<audit_name>/<run_uuid>/`.
- One checklist heading and one ordered top-level checklist-section list.
- One task-result path family `tmp/<audit_name>/<run_uuid>/<section_slug>.<agent_id>.result.md`.
- The shared task-result validator `lib/section-audit/tool/audit_section_result_check.py`.
- One final report path family under `tmp/`.
- The shared merger `lib/section-audit/tool/audit_report_merge.py` and report validator `lib/section-audit/tool/audit_report_check.py`.

## Run State
- Create one `run_uuid` with `uuidgen`.
- Create `tmp/<audit_name>/<run_uuid>/agent.json` before assigning work.
- Use the `agent-workflows` plugin support owner `lib/subagent-transport/protocol.md` in `agent_pool` mode.
- `agent.json` MUST be a flat JSON object whose keys are current active `agent_id` values.
- `agent.json` values are workflow-local metadata owned by this protocol; each current value MUST include the current `section_slug`.
- `section_slug` MUST be the stable snake_case form of the literal top-level checklist-section heading.

## Section Tasks
- Create exactly one section task per top-level checklist section in canonical checklist order.
- Each section task MUST include the literal top-level checklist-section heading and every checklist item that belongs to that section in canonical order.
- Each section task MUST include every skill-required checklist-card metadata field literally, without parent-local paraphrase or weakening.
- Each section task MUST include the resolved scope entries, reviewed files, user focus notes when present, and exact required task-result path pattern.
- Different top-level checklist sections MUST NOT be merged into one task, and one top-level checklist section MUST NOT be split across multiple tasks.

## Section Agents
- The default section-agent profile is one dedicated default sub-agent per top-level checklist section with `fork_context=false`.
- The owning skill MAY declare a named project agent or another runtime-supported agent creation profile for section agents.
- Send all section tasks in parallel.
- If one required section sub-agent cannot be created through the selected profile, the owning skill MUST fail explicitly.
- Corrective feedback for one invalid section-task result MUST go to the same section agent while `lib/subagent-transport/protocol.md` keeps that agent current.

## Result Handling
- Validate every written section-task result with the skill-local task-result validator before merging it.
- Formal validation MUST NOT semantically re-grade, weaken, or strengthen section-agent findings.
- The parent MUST merge only validated section-task results into the final report in canonical checklist order.
- The parent MUST NOT replace missing section-agent findings with locally improvised findings.
- Validate the final report with the skill-local final report validator before returning the report path.
