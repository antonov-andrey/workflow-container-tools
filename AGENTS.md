# Repository Guidelines

## Required Standards

- `project-standards:project-foundation` applies to all work in this repository.
- `project-standards:project-instruction-developer` applies to plugin skills and instruction references.
- `project-standards:project-documentation-developer` applies to `DESIGN.md` and maintained documentation.
- `project-standards:python-developer`, `project-standards:python-cli-developer`, and `project-standards:pytest-developer` apply to provider-owned Python tools and tests.

If one required provider skill is unavailable, continue read-only discovery only and do not mutate this repository until the provider is restored.

## Project Contract

- This repository is the canonical Codex marketplace source `agent-plugins`.
- Generic task workflows live only under `plugins/agent-workflows/`.
- Reusable marketplace-domain agent procedures live only under `plugins/marketplace-agent-tools/`.
- Reusable workflow-container agent procedures live only under `plugins/workflow-container-agent-tools/`.
- This repository is not a runtime dependency of application or workflow-container code.
- Product-specific logic, configuration, prompts, validators, and data remain in their owning application repositories.
- `DESIGN.md` owns the stable provider architecture and cross-project artifact model.
- Active task pairs live only under the ignored `.spec/` root; completed or abandoned pairs must be removed.
- The repository exposes no Python distribution or project-discovery CLI.

## Required Workflows

- `agent-workflows:code-writer` applies to provider code changes.
- `agent-workflows:instruction-writer` applies to plugin skills and instruction references.
- `agent-workflows:git-commit` applies when repository changes are committed or pushed.
- `agent-workflows:goal-brainstorm` applies when stable design or a persistent implementation goal is prepared.
- `marketplace-agent-tools:ozon-seller-api-developer` applies to its owned marketplace-domain skill.
- `workflow-container-agent-tools:workflow-container-developer` applies to workflow-container plugin content.

## Commands

- Validate each plugin with `python ~/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py <plugin-root>`.
- Validate each skill with `python ~/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py <skill-root>`.
- Format changed Python with `black --target-version py314 --line-length 120 <python-scope>`.
- Run provider tests with `pytest -q`.
